# ROS AGV Navigation

[![Workspace-2_001.png](https://s8.gifyu.com/images/Workspace-2_001.png)](https://gifyu.com/image/C8TD)

this project make navigation stack in ros noetic (ubuntu 20.04):

+ The actuator: use [turtle_bot_3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/) simulation for run move_base and lidar message (sensor_msgs/LaserScan).

+ Use [rviz_navigation_setup](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Using%20rviz%20with%20the%20Navigation%20Stack) for monitor information.

## Getting Start

First, you must read tutorial in [navigation_wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup).

You must run turtle bot 3 gazebo before run your navigation launch because your module get data from gazebo app.

## Odometry 
In my Project, i create a repeat odometry from gazebo_node (turtlebot3 simulation).

Here is my result:
